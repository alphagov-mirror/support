<p>
  The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/business-uk-leaving-eu">EU Exit business
  readiness</a> tool aims to help businesses find content that gives them
  actionable steps to prepare for EU Exit. It asks users a series of questions
  before showing them links to relevant content in a
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-eu-exit-guidance-business">finder</a>.
  Content shown in the finder is already published on GOV.UK.
</p>

<h4>Adding content to the finder</h4>

<p>
  Content must be in a GOV.UK guidance format (such as a detailed guide or a
  guidance publication) to be included in the finder. You can submit content
  which is either in draft or has been published.
</p>

<p>
  Formats such as news stories or press releases cannot be added to the tool.
  We’d also not recommend adding policy papers or correspondence as this is not
  a guidance format.
</p>

<p>
  If you’re unsure, please <a href="/content_advice_request/new">contact GOV.UK
  content support</a> before completing this form.
